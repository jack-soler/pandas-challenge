In this challenge I found data about a school system and used pandas to understand the data. 

In the district I found that on average, students have a higher reading score and more likely to pass reading with only a 61 percent of passing overall.

I also was able to find the average math and reading scores by school.

Pena High School had both the highest reading score and the highest math score.

One conclusion I can draw from this is that the more money that is spent on a school, their scores go down.

However, this must also consider other factors such as that struggling schools may get more money to help their students.

I was also able to see that Charter schools has a substantially bigger passing rates than District and may do a better job at helping their students succeed.
